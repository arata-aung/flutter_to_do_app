## What's Ready for Play Store

### Required for Testing (Internal/Closed Testing):
✅ Unique application ID  
✅ Proper versioning  
✅ App name and label  
✅ Launcher icon  
✅ Release build configuration  

### Required for Production Release:
✅ Unique application ID  
✅ Release build optimization (minify, shrink)  
✅ ProGuard rules configured  
✅ App description and metadata prepared  
✅ Custom branding (icon and splash screen)  
⚠️ **Release signing**: Currently using debug keys (needs production keystore)  
⚠️ **Privacy policy URL**: Update with actual URL if needed  
⚠️ **Support email**: Update with actual support contact  

## Next Steps for Developer

### Before Uploading to Play Store:

1. **Create Release Keystore** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/key.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias key
   ```

2. **Configure Signing** in `android/app/build.gradle`:
   - Create `android/key.properties` file with keystore details
   - Update signing configuration in release build type
   - See: https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/android#signing-the-app

3. **Build Release AAB**:
   ```bash
   flutter build appbundle --release
   ```
   - Output: `build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`

4. **Test Release Build**:
   ```bash
   flutter build apk --release
   flutter install --release
   ```

5. **Prepare Play Store Assets**:
   - Take screenshots (phone, tablet, etc.)
   - Create feature graphic (1024x500px)
   - Prepare app icon (512x512px)
   - Write privacy policy if needed
   - Set up support email

6. **Upload to Play Console**:
   - Go to https://play.google.com/console
   - Create app listing
   - Upload AAB file
   - Fill in all required metadata (use PLAY_STORE_LISTING.md as guide)
   - Set up internal testing track
   - Add test users
   - Submit for review

## Privacy & Permissions

- ✅ **No Internet Permission Required**: App uses local storage only (Hive)
- ✅ **Data Privacy**: All data stored locally on device
- ✅ **No Data Collection**: App doesn't collect or transmit user data

## Notes

- The app is fully functional for internal/closed testing
- For production release, complete the signing configuration
- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Custom branding provides professional appearance for Play Store
