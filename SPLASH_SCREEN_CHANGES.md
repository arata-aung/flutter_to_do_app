# Splash Screen Changes

## Overview
The splash screen has been updated from the default Flutter white background to a custom branded design.

## Before (Default Flutter)
- Plain white background
- No branding or visual interest
- Generic Flutter default icon

## After (Custom Design)
- **Yellow gradient background**: Diagonal gradient from light yellow (#FFF9C4) through bright yellow (#FFEB3B) to golden yellow (#FBC02D)
- **Custom splash icon**: White circular badge with golden checkmark and to-do list lines
- **Branded appearance**: Matches the app's theme and purpose
- **Professional look**: Suitable for Google Play Store

## Launcher Icon Changes
- **Adaptive icon support**: Uses Android's adaptive icon system (API 26+)
- **Yellow background**: Solid yellow (#FFEB3B) background color
- **Custom foreground**: To-do themed icon with checkmark and list lines
- **Consistent branding**: Matches the splash screen design

## Technical Details
- Modified `android/app/src/main/res/drawable/launch_background.xml`
- Modified `android/app/src/main/res/drawable-v21/launch_background.xml`

- Stands out on device home screens
- Creates a warm, inviting first impression
- Aligns with the app's Material Design theme (primarySwatch: Colors.yellow)
