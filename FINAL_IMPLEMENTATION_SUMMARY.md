## Design Decisions

### Why Maps Over Lists?
- **Flexibility**: Easy to add new fields
- **Clarity**: Named fields are self-documenting
- **Extensibility**: Future features easier to add
- **Migration**: Can handle missing fields gracefully

### Why One Level of Sub-notes?
- **As Requested**: Requirement specified one level
- **Simplicity**: Keeps UI manageable
- **Usability**: Deep nesting can be confusing
- **Performance**: Simpler data structure

### Why Gradients?
- **Modern**: Material Design 3 aesthetic
- **Visual Interest**: More engaging than flat colors
- **Hierarchy**: Helps distinguish elements
- **Professional**: Contemporary app design

### Why These Icons?
- **Common Use Cases**: Cover most user needs
- **Clear Meaning**: Immediately understandable
- **Material Design**: Consistent with Flutter icons
- **Sufficient Variety**: 8 options provide good choice
